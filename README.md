This is a simple color guessing game built with newest Next.js stuff. You're presented a random color and your goal is to guess its RGB values.

It uses many bleeding-edge stuff, therefore, I'm not fully happy with the implementation. I'm probably going to polish some stuff when they're fixed inside of Next.js
